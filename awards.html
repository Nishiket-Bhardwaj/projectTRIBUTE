                <p>At his prime Kishore Kumar's dominance in Hindi film music was so absolute that virtually all other singers were reduced to mere also-rans. Kishoreda's unrivaled stature was borne out by the plethora of awards and laurels that come his way with amazing regularity. His songs wooed the masses and swept all the music awards of the land.

                    Till date Kishore Kumar holds the record of winning the most number of Best Male Playback Filmfare Awards -- eight times. The great Mohammed Rafi had won it on six occasions. Kishore won his maiden Filmfare Award for the song Roop Tera Mastana from the 1969 movie Aradhana. Apart from Kumar Sanu, Kishore da is the only singer to score a hattrick of Filmfare Awards, winning it consecutively from 1982-85.
                    
                    In the 1984 Filmfare Awards, Kishore Kumar notched up the rare feat of having all the Best Male Playback nominations to himself, such was his unsurpassed supremacy. All the four nominated songs were from his film Sharabi and he won the title for the number Manzilen Apni Jagah. This song also helped Kishore Kumar bag the National Award for that year.
