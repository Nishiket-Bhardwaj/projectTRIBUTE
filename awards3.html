               <h3>HE WAS THE SECOND INDIAN TO BE ELECTED A FELLOW OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY</h3>
               <p>In 1918, Ramanujan became one of the youngest Fellows of the Royal Society and only the second Indian member. The same year he was elected a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, the first Indian to be so honored. During his short lifespan of 32 years, Ramanujan independently compiled around 3,900 results. </p>

               <h3>THE FASTEST ALGORITHMS FOR CALCULATION OF PI ARE BASED ON HIS SERIES</h3>
               <p>Finding an accurate approximation of π (pi) has been one of the most important challenges in the history of mathematics. In 1914, Srinivasa Ramanujan found a formula for computing pi that converges rapidly. His formula computes a further eight decimal places of π with each term in the series. It was in 1989, that Chudnovsky brothers computed π to over 1 billion decimal places on a supercomputer using a variation of Ramanujan’s infinite series of π. This was a world record for computing the most digits of pi. Moreover, the Ramanujan series is currently the basis for the fastest algorithms used to calculate π. </p>

               <h3>THE RAMANUJAN CONJECTURE PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THE FAMOUS LANGLANDS PROGRAM</h3>
               <p>In 1916, Ramanujan published his paper titled “On certain arithmetical functions”. In the paper, Ramanujan investigated the properties of Fourier coefficients of modular forms. Though the theory of modular forms was not even developed then, he came up with three fundamental conjectures that served as a guiding force for its development. His first two conjectures helped develop the Hecke theory, which was formulated 20 years after his paper, in 1936, by German mathematician Erich Hecke. However, it was his last conjecture, known as the Ramanujan conjecture, that created a sensation in in 20th century mathematics. It played a pivotal role in the Langlands program, which began in 1970 through the proposal of American-Canadian mathematician Robert Langlands</p>       </div>

               <h3>HE DEVELOPED THE INFLUENTIAL CIRCLE METHOD IN PARTITION NUMBER THEORY</h3>
               <p>A partition for a positive integer n is the number of ways the integer can be expressed as a sum of positive integers. For example p(4) = 5. That means 4 can be expressed as a sum of positive integers in 5 ways: 4, 3+1, 2+2, 2+1+1 and 1+1+1 +1. Ramanujan, along with G. H. Hardy, invented the circle method which gave the first approximations of the partition of numbers beyond 200. This method was largely responsible for major advances in the 20th century of notoriously difficult problems such as Waring’s conjecture and other additive questions.</p>      </div>

               <h3>HE DISCOVERED THE THREE RAMANUJAN’S CONGRUENCES</h3>
     <p>Related to the Partition Theory of Numbers, Ramanujan also came up with three remarkable congruences for the partition function p(n). They are p(5n+4) = 0(mod 5); p(7n+4) = 0(mod 7); p(11n+6) = 0(mod 11). For example, the first congruence means that if an integer is 4 more than a multiple of 5, then number of its partitions is a multiple of 5. The study of Ramanujan type congruence is a popular research topic of number theory. It was in 2011, that a conceptual explanation for Ramanujan’s congruences was finally discovered. Ramanujan’s work on partition theory has applications in a number of areas including particle physics (particularly quantum field theory) and probability.</p>

           <h3>NUMBER 1729 IS NAMED HARDY–RAMANUJAN NUMBER</h3>
 <p>In a famous incident British mathematician G. H. Hardy while visiting Ramanujan had ridden in a taxi cab with the number 1729. He remarked to Ramanujan that the number “seemed to me rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavourable omen”. “No,” Ramanajun replied, “it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.” The two different ways are: 1729 = 13 + 123 = 93 + 103. 1729 is now known as the Hardy–Ramanujan number. Moreover, numbers that are the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in n distinct ways are now referred to as taxicab numbers due to the incident. The relevance of 1729 has recently come to light as it was part of a much larger theory that Ramanujan was developing. Theorems have been established in theory of elliptic curves that involve this fascinating number.</p>

       <h3>HE DID GROUNDBREAKING RESEARCH RELATED TO FERMAT’S LAST THEOREM</h3>
<p>In 2013 famous Japanese American Mathematician Ken Ono, along with Sarah Trebat-Leder, found an equation by Ramanujan had clearly showed that he had been working on Fermat’s last theorem, one of the most notable and difficult to prove theorems in the history of mathematics. In 1637, French mathematician Pierre de Fermat had asserted that: if n is a whole number greater than 2, then there are no positive whole number triples x, y and z, such that xn + yn = zn. This means that there are no numbers which satisfy the equations: x3 + y3 = z3; x4 + y4 = z4; and so on.</p>

       <h3>HIS MOCK MODULAR FORMS MAY UNLOCK THE SECRET OF BLACK HOLES</h3>
<p>In a 1920 letter to Hardy, Ramanujan described several new functions that behaved differently from known theta functions, or modular forms, and yet closely mimicked them. These were the first ever examples of mock modular forms. More than 80 years later, in 2002, a description for these functions was provided by Sander Zwegers. Further, Ramanujan predicted that his mock modular forms corresponded to ordinary modular forms producing similar outputs for roots of 1. Ken Ono ultimately showed that a mock modular form could be computed just as Ramanujan predicted.</p>
