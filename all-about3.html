                Srinivasa Ramanujan was an Indian mathematician who made significant contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, and continued fractions. What made his achievements really extraordinary was the fact that he received almost no formal training in pure mathematics and started working on his own mathematical research in isolation. Born into a humble family in southern India, he began displaying signs of his brilliance at a young age. He exceled in mathematics as a school student, and mastered a book on advanced trigonometry, written by S. L. Loney, by the time he was 13. While in his mid-teens, he was introduced to the book ‘A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics’ which played an instrumental role in awakening his mathematical genius.</p>

                <h2>Childhood & Early Life</h2>
                <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was born on 22 December 1887, in Erode, Madras Presidency, British India, to K. Srinivasa Iyengar and his wife Komalatammal. His family was a humble one and his father worked as a clerk in a sari shop. His mother gave birth to several children after Ramanujan, but none survived infancy.
                    Ramanujan contracted smallpox in 1889 but recovered from the potentially fatal disease. As a young child, he spent considerable time in his maternal grandparents’ home.
                    He started his schooling in 1892. Initially, he did not like school. However, he soon started exceling in academics, especially mathematics.
                    By the time he was 17, he had independently developed and investigated the Bernoulli numbers and had calculated the Euler–Mascheroni constant up to 15 decimal places. He was no longer interested in any other subject as he became totally immersed in the study of mathematics.
                    He graduated from ‘Town Higher Secondary School’ in 1904 and was awarded the ‘K. Ranganatha Rao’ prize for mathematics by the school's headmaster, Krishnaswami Iyer.</p>

                <h2>Later Years</h2>
                <p>After dropping out of college, he struggled to make a living and lived in poverty for a while. He also suffered from poor health and had to undergo surgery in 1910. After recuperating, he continued his search for a job.
                    He tutored some college students while desperately searching for a clerical position in Madras. Finally, he had a meeting with deputy collector V. Ramaswamy Aiyer who had recently founded the ‘Indian Mathematical Society.’ Impressed by the young man’s works, Aiyer sent him with letters of introduction to R. Ramachandra Rao, the district collector for Nellore and the secretary of the ‘Indian Mathematical Society.’
                    Rao, though initially skeptical of the young man’s abilities, soon changed his mind after Ramanujan discussed elliptic integrals, hypergeometric series, and his theory of divergent series with him. Rao agreed to help him get a job and also promised to financially fund his research.
                    Ramanujan landed a clerical post with the ‘Madras Port Trust,’ and continued his research with financial help from Rao. His first paper, a 17-page work on Bernoulli numbers, was published with the help of Ramaswamy Aiyer, in the ‘Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society’ in 1911.
                    The publication of his paper helped him gain attention. Soon, he was popular among the mathematical fraternity in India. Wanting to explore further in mathematics, Ramanujan began a correspondence with the acclaimed English mathematician Godfrey H. Hardy in 1913.</p>

            <h2>Personal Life & Legacy</h2>
            <p>He married a ten-year-old girl named Janakiammal in July 1909 when he was in his early-20s. The marriage was arranged by his mother. The couple did not have any children, and it is possible that the marriage was never consummated.
                Ramanujan suffered from various health problems throughout his life. His health declined considerably while he was living in England as the climatic conditions did not suit him. Also, he was a vegetarian and found it extremely difficult to obtain nutritious vegetarian food in England.
                He was diagnosed with tuberculosis and suffered a severe vitamin deficiency during the late-1910s. He returned to Madras in 1919. He never fully recovered and breathed his last on 26 April 1920, aged just 32.</p>

            <h2>The Man Who Knew Infinity</h2>
            <p>Ramanujan's published papers — 37 in total — Berndt reveals that "a huge portion of his work was left behind in three notebooks and a 'lost' notebook. These notebooks contain approximately 4,000 claims, all without proofs. Most of these claims have now been proved, and like his published work, continue to inspire modern-day mathematics." </p>
            <p>A biography of Ramanujan titled The Man Who Knew Infinity was published in 1991, and a movie of the same name starring Dev Patel as Ramanujan and Jeremy Irons as Hardy, premiered in September 2015 at the Toronto Film Festival.</p>
