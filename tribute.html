            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Kishore Kumar, original name Abhas Kumar Ganguly, (born August 4, 1929, Khandwa, British India—died October 13, 1987, Bombay [now Mumbai]), Indian actor, playback singer, composer, and director known for his comic roles in Indian films of the 1950s and for his expressive and versatile singing voice, which, in the course of a career that spanned nearly four decades, he lent to many of India’s top screen actors.</p>
            <p>Kumar was the youngest child of a Bengali professional family that had settled in west-central India, in the present-day state of Madhya Pradesh. When he was a teenager, he got a job in Bombay (now Mumbai) as an occasional chorus singer at the Bombay Talkies film studio, where his elder brother Ashok Kumar was the reigning star. Although his heart was in singing, the younger Kumar made his acting debut in 1946 in the nondescript film Shikari. It was the 1951 release of Andolan, however, that propelled him to stardom as a singer-actor and ultimately freed him from the shadow of his brother Ashok.</p>
