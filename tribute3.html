                <h2>About</h2>
               <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was one of India's greatest mathematical geniuses. He made substantial contributions to the analytical theory of numbers and worked on elliptic functions, continued fractions, and infinite series.</p>
               <p>Ramanujan left a number of unpublished notebooks filled with theorems that mathematicians have continued to study. G N Watson, Mason Professor of Pure Mathematics at Birmingham from 1918 to 1951.</p>

                <h2>Contributions and Acheivements</h2>
                <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was a self-taught Indian mathematical genius who made numerous contributions in several mathematical fields including mathematical analysis, infinite series, continued fractions, number theory and game theory. Ramanujan provided solutions to mathematical problems that were then considered unsolvable. Moreover, some of his work was so ahead of his time that mathematicians are still understanding its relevance.</p>
                <p>In 1914, Ramanujan found a formula for computing π (pi) that is currently the basis for the fastest algorithms used to calculate π. The circle method, which he developed with G. H. Hardy, constitute a large area of current mathematical research. Moreover, Ramanujan discovered K3 surfaces which play key roles today in string theory and quantum physics; while his mock modular forms are being used in an effort to unlock the secret of black holes.</p>

                <p>In 1918, he was elected as one of the youngest Fellows in the history of Royal Society for his investigation in Elliptic functions and the Theory of Numbers.</p>
                <p>In the same year, he was the first Indian who was honoured by being elected as a Fellow of Trinity College.</p>
