                <p>Kishore Kumar was an actor, and playback singer in Bollywood films.  He was most active from 1949 until his death in 1987.  He was famous for singing upbeat light songs, and light comical acting roles.  However in his long career, he worked in almost every capacity in the film industry; not only as a a singer and actor but as a screenwriter, producer, director, and script writer.

                    Kishore Kumar was born Abhas Kumar Ganguly on August 4, 1929 in Khandwa (present day Madhya Pradesh).  Although this is a Hindi speaking area he was a Bengali.  His father was a lawyer named was Kunjilal, and his mother's name was Gouri Devi.  He was one of four children.  He had two older brothers named Ashok Kumar and Anoop Kumar, and a younger sister named Sati.
                    
                    Kishore Kumar's entrance to the film industry was very different from most people.  Most of the famous playback singers struggled hard to find a position and struggled equally hard, often unsuccessfully to retain that position.  However Kishore Kumar easily slid into the film industry without any real effort.  The reason for this was through the influence of his elder brother Ashok Kumar.
                    
                    Kishore Kumar never had any formal musical training but this did not stop him.  In his career he showed proficiency in a variety of musical styles.</p>

                <p>Kishore Kumar's personal life during this period is somewhat mixed.  In 1951 he married the first of his four wives, the actress / singer Ruma Guha Thakurta (a.k.a. Ruma Ghosh).  This marriage lasted until 1958 when they divorced.  This union produced a son, Amit Kumar.  (Today Amit Kumar is a noted actor, singer, music director and director.)</p>

                <p> In 1960 he married the actress Madhubala (real name Mumtaz Begum Jehan Dehlavi) with whom he had worked in such films as "Chalti ka Naam Gaadi" (1958).  This marriage created considerable ill will in the family because he was Hindu and she was Muslim.  Their marriage was a civil marriage and Kishore Kumar's parents refused to attend.  Later Kishore and Madhubala had a Hindu ceremony to appease his parents, but to very little advantage.  After only a month of marriage, she leaves the Kumar's household and returns to her own residence.

                    They remain married for the rest of her life, but under somewhat strained circumstances.  At the time she was suffering from a heart condition.  It became progressively worse and she died on February 23, 1969.</p>
                    <p>In 1976 Kishore Kumar married his third wife, the film actress Yogeeta Bali.  However this marriage did not last, they divorce in 1978.In 1980 he marries his fourth wife, the film actress Leena Chandavarkar.  She bares him a son named Sumeet Kumar.  They remain married until his death in 1987.</p>

                <p>1986 was a critical year for Kishor Kumar.  He suffers from a heart attack.  He recovers from the this, but it causes him to greatly reduce his recording schedule.  He plans to go into retirement and return to his birthplace of Khandwa; but this just does not seem to happen.  Kishore's last recording was a playback song for Mithun Chakraborty.  This was a duet with Asha Bhosle for the film "Waqt Ki Aawaz" (1988).

                    In 1987 he suffers another massive heart attack in Bombay.  He died on October 13, 1987, at the age of 58.  His body was taken back to his birthplace of Khandwa for cremation.
                    
                    Kishore Kumar's reputation remains unabated after his death.  There are endless streams of commemorative works, remixes and repackaging of earlier recordings.</p>
